    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (85g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (71g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (180g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons (28g) milk, optional for cakier cookies</li>
            <li>2 cups (227g to 340g) chips, nuts, and/or dried fruit, optional</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line with parchment.</li>
            <li>Beat together the butter, sugars, vanilla, salt, baking powder, and baking soda till well combined and lightened in color.</li>
            <li>Add the egg, beating till smooth. Scrape the sides of the bowl, and beat again till smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, mixing it in completely.</li>
            <li>If you're making cookies using chips, nuts, etc, beat in the milk, then the add-ins. If you're making plain cookies, without add-ins, omit the milk.</li>
            <li>Drop the cookies by the generous tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2" apart. A tablespoon cookie scoop works well here.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 10 to 14 minutes (or up to 16 minutes; ovens may vary). The cookies should be a light golden brown, and a bit darker around the edges. For softer cookies, bake the shorter amount of time; for crunchy cookies, bake longer.</li>
            <li>Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Store these chocolate chip cookies airtight at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.</li>
        </ol>
